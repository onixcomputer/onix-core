## User Preferences
- (accumulate here as you learn them)

## Patterns That Work
- SSH into target machines to get actual journal logs rather than guessing from deploy output
- Building locally with `nix eval` to inspect generated configs (TOML, systemd units)
- Running the service binary locally against the generated config to reproduce errors

## Patterns That Don't Work
- Speculating about config issues without checking actual server logs — the deploy output only shows systemd wrapper messages, not the actual service error
- Assuming config parsing is the issue when traefik exits fast — port conflicts also cause instant exit

## Domain Notes
- ollama model-pull service needs HOME set — the ollama binary panics with `$HOME is not defined` if HOME isn't in the systemd environment. Fixed in modules/ollama/default.nix by adding `HOME = "/var/lib/ollama"`.
- vLLM on aspen1 uses Docker image `kyuz0/vllm-therock-gfx1151:latest` which is broken (undefined symbol: rsmi_is_P2P_accessible). The llm-gptoss service has autoStart=false but the unit was still cycling.
- aspen1/aspen2 are Framework Desktop with AMD Ryzen AI MAX+ 395, Radeon 8060S (gfx1151), 128GB unified memory. Kernel 6.18.2. TTM params allocate ~124GB as GPU VRAM.
- qwen3.5:122b (122B-A10B MoE) = 81GB on ollama. Fits in the 124GB VRAM allocation with room for KV cache.
- llm-agents.nix (numtide) is client-side tooling only — coding agents, not model serving. `qwen-code` talks OpenAI-compatible API, can point at local ollama.
- Project uses clan-core framework for NixOS infrastructure management
- Tag-based service deployment (all, tailnet, dev, desktop, etc.)
- Services are configured in `inventory/services/` and modules in `modules/`
- Secrets managed via SOPS with age encryption
- britton-desktop has Tailscale Serve manually configured (not in NixOS config) — can conflict with Traefik port 443
- The tailscale-traefik module's `static.settings`/`dynamic.settings` were wrong options (never existed in nixpkgs); fixed to `staticConfigOptions`/`dynamicConfigOptions` in commit 20ae2dc
- Traefik is v3.6.10; has deprecated options (disablePropagationCheck → propagation.disableChecks, delayBeforeCheck → propagation.delayBeforeChecks)
- **Darwin/macOS support**: clan-core produces `darwinConfigurations` output but `parts/clan.nix` must explicitly inherit it. Set `machineClass = "darwin"` in the machine definition. nix-darwin is already a transitive dep of clan-core.
- macOS machines need local-path flake inputs (wrappers, clonadic) rsynced and git-init'd on the target since `specialArgs` references them for all machines.
- First darwin-rebuild must be run locally on the Mac: `nix shell nixpkgs#git -c sudo nix run nix-darwin/master#darwin-rebuild -- switch --flake .#britton-air`
- britton-air gets DHCP — IP can change (was .60, moved to .54). Consider static lease or Tailscale hostname for deploy target.
- Darwin machines need `system.stateVersion = 6` and `system.primaryUser` set explicitly.
- `claude-code-bin` only exists for linux in nixpkgs; darwin has `claude-code` instead.
- The `all` tag (all.nix) has NixOS-specific options (boot, systemd, networking.nftables, etc.) — can't be applied to darwin machines. Roster requires `all` tag, so home-manager for darwin needs a different approach.
